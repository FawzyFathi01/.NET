/*
 * Intro to OOP
 * 
 * Class and Object
 * # Class:
 *      - A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines properties (fields), methods, and events that an object can have.
 * # Object:
 *      - An object is an instance of a class. It is created from a class and can have its own values for the properties defined by the class.
 *
 * # Constructor
 *      - A constructor is a special method that is called when an object is instantiated. It usually initializes the fields of the object. 
 *      - Constructor chaining is when one constructor calls another constructor within the same class. 'This' can help in reducing code duplication and initializing objects in multiple steps.
 *
 * # Access Modifiers
 * Access modifiers define the accessibility of classes and class members. C# has several access modifiers:
 *      - Public: The member is accessible from any other code.
 *      - Private: The member is accessible only within its own class.
 *      - Protected: The member is accessible within its own class and by derived classes.
 *      - Internal: The member is accessible within its own assembly but not from another assembly.
 *
 *
 */

// Encapsulation / Inherance / Polymorphism   
/*
 * Encapsulation
 * Definition: is the mechanism of restricting access to some of the object's components and making
 * only certain fields and methods accessible. This is usually achieved using access modifiers like private, protected, and public.
 *
 * Key Points:
 *      - Private Members: Hide the internal state of the object.
 *      - Public Methods: Provide controlled access to the private members through getters and setters.
 */

/*
 * Inheritance
 * Definition:
 * Inheritance allows one class to inherit the properties and methods of another class. The class that inherits is
 * called the derived class or child class, and the class being inherited from is called the base class or parent class.
 *
 * Key Points:
 *      - Base Class: The class being inherited from.
 *      - Derived Class: The class that inherits from the base class.
 *      - Reusability: Promotes code reusability and reduces redundancy.
 *  
 */
/*
 *
 * Polymorphism
 * Definition: allows methods to do different things based on the object they are acting upon, even though they share the same name.
 * It can be achieved through method overriding and interfaces in C#.
 *
 *  Key Points:
 *      - Method Overriding: Redefining a base class's method in a derived class with the same signature.
 *      - Interfaces: Different classes can implement the same interface, which allows for method polymorphism.
 * 
 */


// Abstraction / Interfaces 
/*
 * An abstract class:- is a class that cannot be instantiated on its own and must be inherited by other classes.
 * It can contain both abstract methods (without implementation) and concrete methods (with implementation).
 * 
 * This helps in reducing complexity and increasing reusability and maintainability of the code.
 * Abstraction can be achieved using abstract classes and interfaces.
 * 
 * 
 * Interfaces :- 
 * An interface is a contract that defines a set of methods and properties that a class must implement.
 * Unlike abstract classes, interfaces cannot contain any implementation.
 * 
 * Key Points
 * Abstract classes can have both abstract and concrete methods. They provide a base class that
 * other classes can inherit and are useful when you want to share common functionality among related classes.
 * Interfaces define a contract with methods and properties that implementing classes must provide.
 * They are useful for achieving multiple inheritance and defining capabilities that can be shared across unrelated classes.
 * Understanding and using abstraction effectively can help you design more flexible, scalable, and maintainable software systems in C#.
 * 
 */

// Struct / Enum 
/*
* 
* Structures (structs) in C# :- are value types that are typically used to encapsulate small groups of related variables. 
* Structs are similar to classes but have some key differences, mainly in terms of their behavior and usage.
* 
* Key Characteristics of Structs
* 1-Value Type: Structs are value types, which means they are stored on the stack and hold their data directly,
* as opposed to reference types (like classes), which are stored on the heap and hold references to their data.
* 2-No Inheritance: Structs cannot inherit from other structs or classes, 
* and they cannot be used as a base for other structs or classes. However, they can implement interfaces.
* 3-Immutability: ensures that once an instance is created, its state cannot change.
* This concept is valuable for thread safety, predictability, and simplicity. By using readonly fields and properties.
* 
* 
* enumeration (enum) is a value type that consists of a set of named constants called the enumerator list.
* Enums are used to define a collection of related constants that can be assigned to a variable, 
* making the code more readable and maintainable.
* 
* Summary
* 1-Enums are value types that consist of named constants.
* 2-Default underlying type is int, but can be changed to other integral types.
* 3-Methods: Enums have several useful methods provided by the Enum class, such as GetName, GetNames, and GetValues.
* 4-Usage: Enums make code more readable and maintainable by providing meaningful names to a set of related values.

// Static types /
/*
 * Static Class: A class that cannot be instantiated and can only contain static members.
 * Static Methods: Methods can called on the class itself rather than on instances of the class ,Deal With Static Member.
 * Static Fields: Variables that are shared among all instances of the class.
 * Static Properties: Static properties can be used to encapsulate static fields.
 * Static Constructors: A static class can have a static constructor, which is called once,
 * before any static members are accessed, and is used to initialize static members.
 *
 */
// Namespaces _ Assemblies 
/*
 * Namespaces :- organize code and prevent naming conflicts by grouping related types.
 * Key Points about Namespaces:
 *      - Declaration: Namespaces are declared using the namespace keyword.
 *      - Hierarchy: Namespaces can be nested, creating a hierarchy.
 *      - Using Directive: The 'using' keyword allows you to access members of a namespace without specifying the full namespace path.
 * Assemblies :- are compiled code libraries that contain one or more namespaces and
 * provide the unit of deployment, versioning, and security in .NET applications.
 * 
 */


// Object Initializers _ Extension Methods
/*
 * 
 * Object initializers :- allow you to initialize an object's properties at the time of creation without explicitly
 * calling a constructor.This provides a more concise and readable way to set properties.
 * 
 * Extension methods :-  allow you to add new methods to existing types without modifying their source code or creating
 * a new derived type.This is particularly useful for extending classes from libraries that you do not control.
 *
 */


// Association_ Aggregation _ Composition
/*
 * 
 * Association :- represents a relationship between two or more objects where all objects have their own lifecycle
 * and there is no ownership between them. It is a "uses-a" relationship.
 * Key Points about Association:
 *  - Bidirectional or Unidirectional: It can be bidirectional (both objects know about each other)
 * or unidirectional (one object knows about the other).
 *  - Lifetime Independence: The existence of one object does not depend on the other.
 * 
 * Aggregation is a special type of association that represents a "whole-part" relationship
 * where the part can exist independently of the whole. It is a "has-a" relationship with a weaker form of ownership.
 * Key Points about Aggregation:
 *  - Weak Ownership: The part can exist independently of the whole.
 *  - Lifetime Independence: Deleting the whole does not delete the part.
 * 
 * Composition:-  is a stronger form of aggregation that represents a "whole-part" relationship
 * where the part cannot exist without the whole. It is a "contains-a" relationship with strong ownership.
 * Key Points about Composition:
 *  - Strong Ownership: The part cannot exist independently of the whole.
 *  - Lifetime Dependence: Deleting the whole deletes the part.
